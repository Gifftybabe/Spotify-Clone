## Overview

The Music Player App is a modern web-based music player built with React. It is a simplified clone of the original Spotify website, designed to demonstrate key functionalities of a music streaming service. The application leverages React Router for seamless navigation and the Context API for efficient state management. The sleek and responsive user interface, designed with Tailwind CSS, offers features such as playing, pausing, and seeking tracks, as well as navigating through a list of songs and albums.
